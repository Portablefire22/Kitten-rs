Going to keep it brief since I don't really know what to include on Readme.md's on these 
small projects, this is the source-code for my website "[Kitten.rs](https://kitten.rs)". 
This project contains every project visible on the site, and some projects that are 
incomplete and/or never going to be finished. 

To read these incomplete project discussions then just navigate to the projects directory. 
I wasn't really thinking when creating the website - I basically just wanted something to 
occupy my domain whilst hosting various Minecraft modpacks - so the layout is ***really*** 
bad right now. Top level .toml files are just for project information: title, timestamp, 
summary, and then the path to the project's content markdown file. The content to every 
project is contained within its own directory, any projects that have multiple pages are 
**probably** contained within a single folder, and the only real exception is the about 
page since that is just a free-standing "about.md" file. 

I should probably update the site to something a bit more modern on the backend, but 
something about the simplicity speaks to me and I don't know if I want to get rid of that 
just yet. Eh, I'll probably update it when I try to get a job - :( - but for now it will 
remain in it's very simple web 1.0 form.
